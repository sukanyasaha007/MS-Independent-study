# Independent Study Learning progress

In this repo I will be tracking my progress on independent study. I will start with Coursera and open ai materials on GANs and RL, google scholar papers, paper on Learning by Watching: Physical Imitation, Robot Learns To Imitate Human Demonstrations Using GAN Networks by AVID etc.

## Resources -

### GAN -

[Coursera GAN Speciallization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans,GANs),

GANs in Action by Jakub Langer,

### RL -

Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow andÂ Yoshua Bengio

## Independent Study Goal

    Weekly IS journal (Github Readme, Google Slides) and document of learning progress
    Weekly short projects on RL and GANs
    Read one-two related papers a week
    Brainstorm ideas for Spring 2022 IS project

## Checklist for the semester

- [x] Weekly report on learning outcome
- [ ] Final github repo of all the assignments and projects done during the semester
- [ ] Finalize plan for Spring 2022 IS project, maintain github repo for the same

## Weekly Progress

[Week-2 - Batch Normalization, Pooling, Upsampling, DCGAN](week2.md)

[Week-3 - Mode Collapse, Binary crossentropy, WGAN](week2.md)
