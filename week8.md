# Week8

## Topic - GANs for Data Augmentation and Privacy

Learnd about different applications of GANs, went through the pros/cons of using them for data augmentation, and how they can improve downstream AI models!

### Hands on-

Built a generator that can be used to help create data to train a classifier

### **Learning Objectives**

1. Explore different applications of GANs and examine their specific applications in data augmentation, privacy, and anonymity.
2. Improve your downstream AI models with GAN-generated data.
