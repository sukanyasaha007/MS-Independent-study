## Topic - Image-to-Image Translation with Pix2Pix

Learnd about image-to-image translation, learn about different applications of this framework, and implement a U-Net generator and Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image translation GAN!

### Hands on-

Built a U-Net for a biomedical imaging segmentation task. thi is not a GAN, generative model, or unsupervised learning task. This is a supervised learning task - this component underlies the Generator component of Pix2Pix.

### **Learning Objectives**

1. Learn and leverage the image-to-image translation framework.
2. Identify extensions, generalizations, and applications of this framework to modalities beyond images.
3. Implement a paired image-to-image translation GAN, called Pix2Pix, to turn satellite images into map routes (and vice versa), with advanced U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator architectures.
