## Topic - GAN Disadvantages and Bias

Learnd the disadvantages of GANs when compared to other generative models, discover the pros/cons of these models—plus, learnd about the many places where bias in machine learning can come from, why it’s important, and an approach to identify it in GANs!

### Hands on-

Explored a way to identify some biases of a GAN using a classifier, in a way that's well-suited for attempting to make a model independent of an input.

### **Learning Objectives**

1. Propose generative model alternatives to GANs and their pros/cons.
2. Scrutinize bias in machine learning and examine its various sources.
3. Describe an application of GANs that demonstrates bias.
4. Explain several definitions of fairness in machine learning.
5. Explain several definitions of fairness in machine learning.
