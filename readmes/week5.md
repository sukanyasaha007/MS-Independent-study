# Week5

## Topic - Feature extraction and Evaluation

WENT THROUGH the challenges of evaluating GANs, learnD about the advantages and disadvantages of different GAN performance measures, and implement the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) method using embeddings to assess the accuracy of GANs!

### Hands on-

Implemented Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)

### **Learning Objectives**

1. Differentiate across different evaluation metrics and their pros/cons.
2. Justify the use of feature embeddings in GAN evaluation.
3. Evaluate your GANs by implementing Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score.
