## Project on Virtual Stylist

Have you ever looked at an Instagram model and wondered - “This summer look is a so gorgeous! how would it look on me?”(see fig 1). This problem requires an application that would recommend similar products and let customers try on these items digitally. This paper proposes a novel computer vision-based technique called Virtual Stylist to tackle two emerging problems of fashion e-commerce platforms- 1. Recommend similar fashion products, 2. Virtual Try-On based on those products. This can be beneficial for e-commerce giants like Amazon, Macy's, Walmart, Gap, Nordstrom, etc. to provide customers with a platform to try out different fashion looks, outfits based on a customer image and a style image.
