# Week7

## Topic - StyleGAN and Advancements

Learnd how StyleGAN improves upon previous models and implemented the components and the techniques associated with StyleGAN, currently the most state-of-the-art GAN with powerful capabilities!

### Hands on-

Implemented various components of StyleGAN, including the truncation trick, the mapping layer, noise injection, adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN), and progressive growing.

### **Learning Objectives**

1. Analyze key advancements of GANs.
2. Build and compose the components of StyleGAN.
3. Investigate the controllability, fidelity, and diversity of StyleGAN outputs.
